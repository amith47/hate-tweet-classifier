# Hate Tweet Classification

This project aims to classify tweets as either 'Hate Tweet' (1) or 'Harmless Tweet' (0) using various text embedding techniques and machine learning models.

## Dataset
- Place your dataset (e.g., `train_E6oV3lV.csv`) in the `data/` folder.

## Embedding Techniques
- Bag-of-Words
- TF-IDF
- BERT
- Universal Sentence Encoder

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Dataset files
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experiments
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- `results/` - Model outputs and evaluation results

## Getting Started
1. Set up a Python environment (recommended: Python 3.8+)
2. Install dependencies (see instructions in the notebooks or scripts)
3. Run the notebooks or scripts to train and evaluate models

## Objective
Compare the performance of different embedding techniques and ML models for hate tweet classification.
